    <!-- story -->

    <p>Following a contentious business application period, Bay Ridge is set to get its first legal cannabis shop next month, pending final inspection by New York State's Office of Cannabis Management.</p>

    <p>Kaya Bliss will open in December on Third Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets, according to co-owner Edgar Kleydman.</p>

    <p>As soon as Kleydman, a 53-year-old financial planner from Bensonhurst, heard that New York was legalizing weed, he knew he wanted to open a dispensary, he said.</p>

    <p>“It's just like Prohibition, when alcohol became legal again,” Kleydman said. “It’s an opportunity of a non-existing industry to come in on the ground floor of an expanding industry.”</p>

    <p>Since New York legalized cannabis in 2021, the state has prioritized dispensary licenses for individuals who have been affected by the criminalization of marijuana. That includes Giorgio Matesi, co-owner of Kaya Bliss, who was arrested decades ago for selling cannabis, according to Kleydman.</p>

    <p>“My partner, when he was a young kid coming out of poverty, dealt a little bit of weed and got arrested once for it,” Kleydman says of Matesi, a 44-year-old former sanitation worker also from Bensonhurst. Today, both Kleydman and Matesi live with their families in Staten Island.</p>

    <p>The news of a cannabis dispensary arriving in Bay Ridge, a residential neighborhood in Brooklyn that tends to skew a <a href="https://bestneighborhood.org/conservative-vs-liberal-map-brooklyn-ny/" target="_blank">bit more conservative</a> than most of the borough, has been met with opposition by Republican lawmakers and some residents.</p>

    <p>In June, Brooklyn's Community Board 10, which represents Bay Ridge, issued a recommendation against the approval of Kleydman and Matesi’s application, arguing that the proposed location for Kaya Bliss is too close to schools. They issued the recommendation after a crowded and tense public hearing, as <a href="https://www.brooklynpaper.com/bay-ridge-cannabis-legal-dispensaries-cb10/" target="_blank">Brooklyn Paper</a> reported.</p>

    <p>Their argument did not have legal standing with the office, given that the Third Avenue location complies with New York’s requirements for dispensaries, including that they not be opened within 500 feet of a school.</p>

    <p>On June 24, Assembly Members Michael Tannousis and Alec Brook-Krasny and U.S. Representative Nicole Malliotakis, all Republicans who represent Bay Ridge, <a href="https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2024/07/01/community-members-led-by-republicans-protest-dispensary/" target="_blank">led a protest</a> outside of the proposed Kaya Bliss location. A crowd of attendees stood with signs that read “No marijuana dispensary near our schools.”</p>

    <p>To Aaron Ghitelman, former deputy communications director of the New York State Office of Cannabis Management, there was nothing shocking about the Republican-led outcry.</p>

    <p>“For Republicans, one way that they can rile up their base and excite their base is by fighting against cannabis legalization,” Ghitelman, a freelance communications specialist, said. “They know that these are legal, compliant businesses that are going to come to their communities, whether or not they personally approve of them.”</p>

    <p>Approximately 61% of New York state residents support legal recreational cannabis use, according to <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/new-yorks-shaky-legal-marijuana-rollout/#:~:text=Nearly%20six%20in%20ten%20New,just%2043%25%20of%20Republicans%20agree." target="_blank">MaristPoll</a>. One such New Yorker is James Pedersen, a 29-year-old financial consultant who lives in Bay Ridge.</p>

    <p>“Instead of having to leave the neighborhood to go get safe, cheap, legal cannabis, you can stay in the neighborhood,” he says of Kaya Bliss’ arrival to Bay Ridge. “Maybe you buy a cup of coffee on the way, have lunch here, whatever. I mean, even if you're just conversing with neighbors and meeting people, I think it helps our social fabric to have something like that.”</p>
